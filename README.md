My name is Thane, 
I need help learning a few basic things that compared to the complexity of coding should in theory be a complete walk in the park
for anyone on here. I only have and am only interested in Apple products
could someone who is genuinely knowledgeable about iPhone ( 14 ) & Mac ( Air    , 2020, M1,  8gb unified memory, 256gb SSD, 13in, ) 
specifically these two products perhaps spare just a little time to help me 
so Iâ€™m not spinning in circles for several more months I would greatly appreciate it.
